Using statistics to train a computer how to play Tic-Tac-Toe.

Monte Carlo methods are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. 
The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle.
By quickly running trial tic-tac-toe games many times and scoring the results, the program has a way to accurately calculate the
probability that an outcome will occur and decide on the best move to make. 

You can play against this program in your browser using CodeSkulptor: a browser-based Python interpreter:
