I used the collaborative filtering technique to generate the top 10 movie recommendations for each user in the dataset. 
This model uses MLlib's alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm to fill in the missing entries of a user-item association matrix.
Built on top of Apache Spark, MLlib is a scalable machine learning library that delivers high-quality algorithms and speed, up to 100x faster than MapReduce.
