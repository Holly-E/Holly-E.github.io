Apache Spark is a general-purpose cluster-computing framework for big data processing. 

This project is a demonstration using PySpark, a Python API for Spark to perform the following:

* Fit a Binary Logistic Regression Model to a dataset
* Data wrangling such as join files, rename and drop columns, print schemas
* Create a report of the top ten airports by the number of inbound passengers (destination) using flight data
* Generate user defined functions to add new columns to a dataframe
