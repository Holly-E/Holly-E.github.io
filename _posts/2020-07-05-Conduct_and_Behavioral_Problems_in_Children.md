This project examines the subset of children who have been told they have behavioral or conduct problems by a doctor or educator. We know there is a high correlation with ADHD. What other factors influence this behavior, and to what extent? What impact does sex of the child have? 

To examine these questions I am using the National Survey of Childrenâ€™s Health, conducted by the United States Census Bureau. The binary classification model predicts a positive response for this target across four years of data (2012, 2016, 2017, 2018). The features used each year will be slightly different based on changes in the survey questions.
