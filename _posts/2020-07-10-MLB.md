Create actionable insights for pitchers and coaches using MLB data.

## Part 1: 
This program allows you to use the data for a new pitch to determine the strike zone locations for higher likelyhood of key outcomes based on the cluster it falls into.
* Uses pitch speed and movement profile to divide the known pitches into clusters using a KMeans Clustering algorithm.
* Data analysis on the clusters to determine the strike zone with the most likely chance for key outcomes: whiffs, soft contacts and ground balls.

## Part 2:
Predicts the exit speed of a ball coming off of a bat using a random forest regressor.
* Feature-engineering included a finding the True Spin using a 30+ step calculation based on Alan Nathan's work, and included pulling data from two API's (stadium elevation and barometric pressure at the time of the game).
