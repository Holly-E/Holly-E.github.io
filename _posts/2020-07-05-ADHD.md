ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting adults as well as an estimated 11% of school-age children. ADHD may lead to serious consequences including school dropout, depression, problems with relationships, substance abuse, delinquency, and job failure. The CDC National Children’s Health Survey (NCHS) 2011-2012 dataset contains the responses regarding over 45,000 females and over 45,000 males (under the age of 18). Males were diagnosed with ADD or ADHD at over twice the rate of females (12% of males vs 5.5% of females had been diagnosed).

Research suggests this may be due to masking, where the child develops techniques to compensate. (Bowman, 2020) An example of this may be a child who doodles or fidgets in their chair, instead of exhibiting “hyperactive” behavior that interrupts their class. A child with undiagnosed ADHD may have coping techniques that are sufficient for grade school, however they are at risk to be unable to cope with greater challenges of adulthood when they have more autonomy. Early diagnosis and treatment are important. Are these people hiding in plain sight, undetected while exhibiting symptoms that they have ADHD?
 
In the dataset, it is possible to create a model with 92% accuracy by predicting that all rows with a 1 for variable 'K2Q34A' (conduct problems) have an ADHD diagnosis. Children who are masking are more likely to have a 0 for this variable, so the focus of this project is on identifying a model that predicts an ADHD diagnosis for their subset of the data. The goal of this project is to identify children who are more likely to be underdiagnosed.
